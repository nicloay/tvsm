  levelInfo: 'Use <b>hot keys</b> or <b>buttons</b> on the right pannel to lead <b>Theseus</b><sprite
    name="theseus"> to the <b>Exit (E)</b>.

    Bad <b>Minotaur</b><sprite name="minotaur">
    make <b>2</b> steps for every <b>single</b> step of Theseus

    But good news,
    Minotaur always makes <b>Left</b>, <b>Right</b> moves first and always tries
    to step using shortest way, like he won''t see the walls.

    Don''t forget
    to use <b>Undo</b> when the game is over, or any time you made an awkward move.


    Good
    luck, and hope to see you at the next level. (argh.. almost forgot, did you see
    the hint button?)'
